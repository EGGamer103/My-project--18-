# My-project--18-

stencil: the stencil shader is roughly Identical to the implementation from the class, the only existing change with the stencil is the addition of the base color to chane the object color more efficiently than through a texture.

scrolling shader: scrolling shader includes an additional texture value with its own implementation of scrolling speed, all added to the final colour. all the blending of textures is has been reduced to appear more transparent and improve the ambience of the scene.

Color correction: the color correction is implemented similarly to my final project using the global volume to implement a universal color correction.

the player controller only allows for 2d movement as is the case in wario land.
